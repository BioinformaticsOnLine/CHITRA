1. **Zoom Option:**

   - Use the mouse scroll button to zoom in and out of the synteny plot
   - Alternatively, click the **zoom icon** located at the upper-right corner of the image for precise control

2. **Adjust Image with Arrows:**

   - Utilize the arrows at the **left corner** of the page to reposition the image and adjust its alignment as needed

3. **Scrolling Bar:**

   - A **scrolling bar** is available below the synteny plot to view the complete image from end to end

4. **Background Color Mode:**

   - Switch between **black** and **white** background modes for optimal visualization
   - The option is accessible via the **navigation bar** or the upper-right corner of the page

5. **Chord Map Settings:**

   - For a customized view of the chord map, a **settings option** is provided just above the map

6. **Navigation Bar:**
   The **movable navigation bar** includes:

   - **Go Back Button:** Return to the previous step
   - **Upload Option:** Upload data files directly
   - **Example Data:** Load example datasets
   - **Filter Button:** Filter required synteny blocks
   - **Hide Button:** Toggle synteny block details
   - **View Button:** Access uploaded data
   - **Background Color Option:** Switch between black and white modes
   - **Orientation Option:** Adjust navigation bar position

# Annotations and Chromosomal Breakpoint Visualization

To visualize chromosomal breakpoints in the reference genome, users can explore the example dataset labeled **"Annotated Genome"**. This dataset includes additional information, such as annotations and chromosomal breakpoints, alongside synteny block data.

Key visualization features:

- **Chromosomal breakpoints** in the reference genome are shown as **red arrows** in the synteny plot
- Breakpoints are highlighted in the **chord map** as **red lines** on the reference genome chord
- These features enable precise identification of structural changes and their genomic locations
