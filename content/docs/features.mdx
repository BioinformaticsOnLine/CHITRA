1. **Zoom Option:**

   - Use the mouse scroll button to zoom in and out of the synteny plot
   - Alternatively, click the **zoom icon** located at the upper-right corner of the image for precise control

2. **Adjust Image with Arrows:**

   - Utilize the arrows at the **left corner** of the page to reposition the image and adjust its alignment as needed

3. **Scrolling Bar:**

   - A **scrolling bar** is available below the synteny plot to view the complete image from end to end

4. **Background Color Mode:**

   - Switch between **black** and **white** background modes for optimal visualization
   - The option is accessible via the **navigation bar** or the upper-right corner of the page

5. **Chord Map Settings:**

   - For a customized view of the chord map, a **settings option** is provided just above the map

6. **Navigation Bar:**
   The **movable navigation bar** includes:
   - **Go Back Button:** Return to the previous step
   - **Upload Option:** Upload data files directly
   - **Example Data:** Load example datasets
   - **Filter Button:** Filter required synteny blocks
   - **Hide Button:** Toggle synteny block details
   - **View Button:** Access uploaded data
   - **Background Color Option:** Switch between black and white modes
   - **Orientation Option:** Adjust navigation bar position

# Annotations and Chromosomal Breakpoint Visualization

To visualize chromosomal breakpoints in the reference genome, users can explore the example dataset labeled **"Annotated Genome"**. This dataset includes additional information, such as annotations and chromosomal breakpoints, alongside synteny block data.

Key visualization features:

- **Chromosomal breakpoints** in the reference genome are shown as **red arrows** in the synteny plot
- Breakpoints are highlighted in the **chord map** as **red lines** on the reference genome chord
- These features enable precise identification of structural changes and their genomic locations

# Color tagging Mutation types

CHITRA provides a color-coding to distinguish between different types of mutations and synteny relationships for the selected ribbons:

1. **Color Tags Feature:**
   - Located in the top navigation bar
   - Allows users to visually categorize and highlight different mutation types

2. **Available Mutation Types:**
   - **SYN (Green):** Syntenic regions
   - **INV (Red):** Inversions
   - **TRANS (Blue):** Translocations
   - **INVTR (Purple):** Inverted translocations
   - **DUP (Yellow):** Duplications

3. **How to Use:**
   - Click on the "Color Tags" button in the top toolbar
   - Select the mutation types you want to highlight
   - The corresponding regions in the synteny plot will be colored according to their mutation type
   - Multiple mutation types can be selected simultaneously for comparative analysis

4. **Visual Integration:**
   - Colors are consistently applied across both the synteny plot and chord map
   - Helps in quick identification and analysis of different genomic rearrangements
   - Enhances the understanding of complex genomic relationships
