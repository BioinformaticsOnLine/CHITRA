# CHITRA

The Chromosome Interactive Tool for Rearrangement Analysis (CHITRA) is an advanced bioinformatics tool designed to study chromosomal rearrangements by providing detailed and interactive visualizations of synteny blocks and chromosome breakpoints. This tool is a powerful resource for investigating evolutionary dynamics across multiple species.

## Features

1. **Synteny Block Visualization:** Conserved regions of chromosomes between different species can be visualised and easy to analyse in forward and inverse direction

2. **Chromosome Breakpoint Analysis:** Breakpoints are mapped and visualized to help researchers identify evolutionary events and their impact on genome organization

3. **Evolutionary Insights:** By analyzing the rearrangement patterns, it supports hypotheses about evolutionary pressures and genetic innovations

4. **User-Friendly Visualization:** Users can dynamically adjust views, compare species, and zoom into specific chromosomal regions of interest

## What are Synteny Blocks?

A synteny block refers to a conserved segment of a genome where genes or sequences are found in the same relative order and orientation across different species or strains. These blocks provide insights into the evolutionary relationships between organisms, helping researchers understand genomic rearrangements, speciation, and structural changes.

### **2.1.2 Using Example Datasets**

CHITRA includes pre-loaded example datasets to help users explore its functionality. Three types of example datasets are available:

1. **Basic Synteny**

   - _Visualize synteny blocks among_ **three species**.
   - Input files required:
     - synteny_data.csv
     - species_data.csv
     - reference_chromosome_sizes.csv

2. **Multiple Synteny**

   - _Compare synteny blocks among_ **multiple species**

   - _Input files required same as_ _Basic Synteny_

     - ref_gene_annotations.csv
     - breakpoints.csv

3. **Annotated Genome**

- _Analyze_ _annotated genomes_ using real datasets.

- _Input files required here are the same as for_ **Multiple Synteny with two more additional files**

  - ref_gene_annotations.csv
  - breakpoints.csv
